<p>This lesson guides learners through analyzing data from a large
database. Scientifically, we are identifying stars in GD-1, a stellar
stream in the Milky Way (creating Figure 1 in “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00425" class="external-link">Off the beaten path: Gaia
reveals GD-1 stars outside of the main stream</a>” by Adrian
Price-Whelan and Ana Bonaca). The first part of this lesson (episodes
1-6) shows learners how to prototype a query, starting by querying a
subset of the sky we ultimately want and then building up stronger and
stronger filters locally. With our filters in place, episode 7 performs
the full query remote on the remote database, giving us a dataset to
visualize in episode 8. Episode 8 demonstrates best practices and tips
and tricks to efficiently and effectively visualize data.</p>
<p>Because this episode follows a single dataset throughout, its easy
for learners (and instructors) to lose sight of the bigger picture and
focus instead on the scientific goals or individual commands. At the
beginning of each episode it is recommended that the instructor discuss
both the scientific goal of the episode (with frequent references to
Figure 1) and highlight the big picture skills that we hope each student
takes away from the episode, beyond the specific science case. At the
end of the episode the instructors should recap the same information,
highlighting the best practices covered.</p>
<p>We have an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfaNFaKIOrY" class="external-link">onboarding video</a>
and accompanying <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YosDXx1gBGpBxf6fCEaazFQwZ2dYTWgtYSdPEeD09yo/edit#slide=id.p" class="external-link">slides</a>
available to prepare Instructors to teach this lesson. After watching
this video, please contact <a href="mailto:team@carpentries.org">team@carpentries.org</a> so that we
can record your status as an onboarded Instructor. Instructors who have
completed onboarding will be given priority status for teaching at
Centrally-Organised Data Carpentry Foundations of Astronomical Data
Science workshops.</p>

<p>Unfortunately these episodes are incredibly cumulative and there is
not much that can be cut along the way. If you are running short on
time, we recommend eliminating or condensing these sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>cutting or stream-lining parts of episode 8 about plotting. This is
the most significant way you can make up time.</li>
<li>stream-line some of the CSV section at the end of episode 6, for
instance skip the read back section which demonstrates how extra columns
can slip into CSV files</li>
<li>cut the “Checking the Match” section of episode 6</li>
<li>cut the part where we check the size of the HDF5 file in episode
4</li>
<li>cut the brief discussion of context managers in episode 4</li>

<li>We explicitly recommend using Jupyter notebooks rather than Jupyter
lab as we have found them more reliable across different platforms and
they require less up front explanation.</li>
<li>As explained in the episodes, we think that it is valuable for
learners to know a little bit about both Astropy <code>Tables</code> and
Pandas <code>DataFrames</code> as they both have strengths and
weaknesses as both an astronomy software standard and an industry
standard.</li>
<li>There is a lot of typing in this curriculum. To best keep with
Carpentries live coding practices - we recommend that you copy and paste
from previous cells as needed and not provide pre-filled notebooks.
Provide learners with links to the on line lessons and reassure them
that they can jump back in at the beginning of any episode if they are
too overwhelmed an need a break.</li>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Astronomical datasets are getting larger and larger. As a result,
astronomical analysis is shifting away from working with raw imaging and
towards analyzing already reduced data (and simulations) that are stored
in large databases. If you know how to ask these databases the right
questions, they are an incredibly powerful tool. The ability to interact
with these large databases is fundamental to the future of astronomy as
well as a skill that is highly valued outside of the astronomical
community.</p></li>
<li><p>Motivate the skills taught in this curriculum with your science
whether it is transients, exoplanets, or weak lensing (or something
else).</p></li>
<li>
<p>Introduce the tools we will be teaching and why you think these
are important for astronomers to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>SQL: general purpose language to interact with databases - used
widely in astronomy and industry</li>
<li>Python: general purpose programming language - used widely in
astronomy and industry</li>
<li>Astropy: package with common astronomical functions and objects to
facilitate analysis of astronomical data</li>
<li>Astroquery: python interface to SQL-flavored astronomical databases
(this might be a good place to show all of the catalogs that astroquery
supports)</li>
<li>Pandas: python package to deal with arrays and databases - used
widely by astronomy and industry</li>
<li>Matplotlib: python visualization package - used widely by astronomy
and industry</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Note that this is a balance of astronomy specific tools which
allow us to efficiently interact with our specific data and broadly used
tools which can prepare learners for a career outside of
academia.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Introduce the skills (and best practices surrounding those
skills) we will be teaching:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing and testing SQL and Python</li>
<li>Working with remote databases</li>
<li>Storing data locally</li>
<li>Validating data and analysis pipelines</li>
<li>Visualizing results</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduce the dataset:</p>
<ul>
<li>Science
<ul>
<li>GD-1 is a stream of stars in the Milky Way that is believed to have
been a globular cluster that was stretched out by the gravitational
potential of the Milky Way</li>
<li>Identify stars in GD-1 using Gaia and Pan-STARRs data which is
stored in the ESA Gaia database</li>
<li>Give a one sentence description of the Gaia and Pan-STARRs
surveys</li>
<li>Reproduce Figure 1 of <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...863L..20P/abstract" class="external-link">Price-Whelan
&amp; Bonaca, 2018</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why this dataset?
<ul>
<li>Uses data from two broadly used surveys which are accessible through
astroquery (which can be used to access a large number of astronomical
surveys)</li>
<li>Two large catalogs make this too big to be done locally</li>
<li>Compelling science case: this analysis extends the known structure
of GD-1, discovers new substructure, and identifies a candidate
progenitor</li>
<li>Compelling use case: the time from data release to publication on
the arXiv was less than a week. This models how efficiently this
workflow can be and also how one could set up the tools before a data
release to quickly turn around a paper</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show Figure 1 from Price-Whelan &amp; Bonaca and describe the
workflow that we are going to go through</p>
<ul>
<li>First we are going to select stars purely based on their location in
the sky near where we know GD-1 exists. Until we figure out our full
query and have a more robust filter, we are going to limit ourselves to
a very small spatial subset of these stars so that we are downloading a
manageable dataset. We will also do a rough filter on color (to avoid
nearby faint foreground stars which are likely to be red) and on
parallax (again to avoid foreground stars)</li>
<li>This is a good time to introduce the GD-1 reference frame
(coordinates phi1 and phi2) where phi1 is parallel to the stream
direction and phi2 is perpendicular to the stream direction. This is the
easiest frame to visualize the stream in and often to set query
constraints.</li>
<li>The first filter we apply will be a filter in proper motion. Because
GD-1 is a stretched out globular cluster, the stars should all be moving
along the stream (parallel to the x-axis). If we plot the proper motion
of all of the stars in the spatial region we selected, we should see a
clump of stars with no motion in phi2 and a non-zero motion in phi1.
These stars are GD-1. The first filter we apply will be to select for
stars with a proper motion that falls in this region of proper motion
space (top right plot). The stars selected are shown on the top left
plot. We will first identify the range of proper motion we are
interested in locally, then we will develop this into a query that can
be performed on the Gaia catalog</li>
<li>This allows us to see GD-1, but there is still a lot of
contamination from non-GD-1 sources. To further refine our filter, we
are going to use the fact that we believe GD-1 was a globular cluster
and therefore all of the stars formed at the same time. This means we
can build a g-i color magnitude diagram (CMD) and select stars that fall
on a single isochrone corresponding to the age of GD-1. To build this
color magnitude diagram we will need the g and i magnitudes from the
Pan-STARRS catalog. The CMD of all of the stars selected based on proper
motion is shows in the bottom right panel of Price-Whelan &amp; Bonaca,
1998 Figure 1, along with the best-fit isochrone. We will then select
stars only around the main sequence of the isochrone. The results of
this selection can be seen in the bottom left panel of Figure 1. You can
see here that GD-1 stands out much more prominently.</li>
<li>Once we have prototyped this query on a small subset of the spatial
extent of GD-1, we will re-run the query on almost the full extent and
recreate Figure 1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For each episode start with an overview - often its good to show
Figure 1 and talk about what you just did and what you are going to do.
Be sure to highlight the learning objectives and discuss how these tools
and skills are applicable beyond this dataset and science case.</p></li>
<li><p>End each episode with a summary of what you just did and going
over the best-practices. Take this as an opportunity to connect the
skills used for this specific science case to the broader skill set that
can be applied to any science case.</p></li>
<li><p>Share links to the episode with learners. There is a lot of
typing and if a student gets stuck debugging a typo, having the episode
can allow them to catch up. Encourage them to type along and only use
the episode as a back up.</p></li>
<li><p>It is recommended that at a minimum each day be a new notebook to
avoid a single notebook that is so large that it become slow to interact
with. While it would be great to demonstrate the best practice of
breaking a complex analysis into multiple notebooks by starting each new
episode in a new notebook, this will add overhead to your teaching time
both to launch a new notebook and get it set up with the previously
defined variables, so use your best judgement based on the level of your
audience. If you decide to start each episode in a new notebook you can
use the “Starting from this Episode” call out at the beginning of each
episode to import and define everything you need from previous episodes.
If you are using files from the <code>student_download</code> directory
be sure to add the correct path
<code>student_download/backup-data/&lt;filename&gt;</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>It is recommended that you do not repeat variable names and that
you do not modify queries in place. If a student misses a step then they
do not have an easy way to determine that they do not have the same code
that you have.</p></li>
<li><p>Although learners should have seen functions in the SWC python
episode, its always good to reiterate the process of prototyping what
you want to do. Then if you find yourself wanting to do it over and
over, make it into a function (a good rule of thumb is if you are copy
and pasting, then think about whether you should be using a
function).</p></li>
<li><p>Highlight throughout the episode what commands are ADQL specific
(<code>CONTAINS</code>, <code>POINTS</code>, <code>POLYGON</code>) and
what are general SQL commands (everything else).</p></li>
<li><p>Errors will happen throughout the workshop. In an online setting
it can be especially useful for learners to share their screen with the
class while you troubleshoot together. This gives other learners the
opportunity to see how you troubleshoot and to see common errors.
However, be aware of the time and do not derail the entire episode if
someone is having an edge case issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Think about how to communicate exercises to learners, especially
in an online setting. In our first beta workshop both instructors and
learners were really happy with <a href="https://hackmd.io" class="external-link">hackmd</a>.</p></li>

<h3 id="episode-1-queries">Episode 1: Queries<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#episode-1-queries"></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>At the beginning of this episode, possible points of confusion
are (1) there are two functions with similar named,
<code>load_tables</code> and <code>load_table</code>, and neither of
them actually downloads a table; rather, they download metadata about
the tables.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that even though we do not use the parallax column for our
analysis, we include it in the results for use in the data exploration
section</p></li>
<li><p>For <code>query2</code> (and most subsequent queries) if a
learner get exactly 2000 results, it is probably because they used
<code>launch_job</code> rather than <code>launch_job_async</code>. This
is a good opportunity to remind learners: if you get exactly 2000
results, check that you did an async query and not a synchronous
query</p></li>
<li><p>One of the challenges of debugging queries is that
<code>astroquery</code> provides basically no debugging information
other than a generic error message. So it is important to emphasize
careful checking of queries and incremental development: starting with a
known-good query and making small changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Throughout the episodes we check the type of our output. This is
a good best practice to make sure that you are getting what you think
you are getting. You can remind learners of this when it comes
up.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="episode-2-coordinates-and-units">Episode 2: Coordinates and units<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#episode-2-coordinates-and-units"></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Highlight how the <code>WHERE</code> and <code>CONTAINS</code>
statements interact - that <code>CONTAINS</code> returns a
<code>1</code> when something is contained within the defined shape and
you are checking where <code>CONTAINS</code> equals <code>1</code>. So
the statement <code>WHERE 1=CONTAINS</code> is true when something is
located in a region.</p></li>
<li><p>Learners struggle with what reference frames we are transforming
between and why. Repeat this as many times as possible. The Gaia catalog
is in a universal frame (ICRS) but it is easier to visualize and create
filters specific to GD-1 when the axes of our reference frame are
aligned with the GD-1 stream direction. So we will be switching between
the ICRS frame and the GD-1 frame often. To the GD-1 frame to build our
filter then to the ICRS frame to actually query the database, then back
to the GD-1 frame to visualize our results.</p></li>
<li><p>Emphasize the basic structure of the SkyCoord object: location
along axis 1, location along axis 2, frame. For example in the ICRS
frame, axis 1 is <code>ra</code> and axis 2 is <code>dec</code>. In the
GD-1 frame, axis 1 is <code>phi1</code> and axis 2 is
<code>phi2</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Mention that we can transform between these different coordinate
systems so easily because we are using a unified framework: astropy.
This allows learners to build a custom frame object and then have access
to all of the other astropy tools that deal with coordinate
transformations.</p></li>
<li><p>When you define phi1_min, phi1_max, etc go back to Figure 1 and
show learners the region you are defining, connecting the min and max
values to the coordinates in the GD-1 frame. This is another place you
can mention the benefit of using the GD-1 frame is that we can define a
rectangle around the stream.</p></li>

<h3 id="episode-3-tabular-data-and-transformations">Episode 3: Tabular Data and Transformations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#episode-3-tabular-data-and-transformations"></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Transforming back: the discussion about the motivation to
transform back to GD-1 frame is a great time to have student build up
some intuition about the proper motion selection and how this relates to
the physical picture. Remind them again that GD-1 is a globular cluster
that is being pulled into a stream along the phi1 direction. This means
that GD-1 stars should have non-zero motion along the phi1 direction and
motion close to 0 in the phi2 direction.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not let learners get too hung up on setting the distance and
radial velocity to constants. For distance, the parallax is so close to
0 that they are unreliable and as mentioned, the radial velocity is to
avoid errors.</p></li>
<li><p>The plot at the end of the reflex correction is a good example of
an intermediate step to determining the best filter for GD-1 stars. You
can imagine doing this data exploration yourself and trying first a
purely spatial plot, then realizing that there are too many non-GD-1
stars included and that you need another way to filter out foreground
stars. Proper motion!</p></li>
<li><p>In this episode we are going to define a few functions that we
will use in other episodes. This process of prototyping inline and then
writing a function is very common. Especially with
<code>make_dataframe</code> this is a good opportunity to show how the
different steps you have performed over the last episode can be
elegantly strung together. While defining these functions now takes a
little longer, its good to do it when the code is still fresh in learn’s
minds and will be really useful later.</p></li>

</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="episode-4-proper-motion">Episode 4: Proper motion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#episode-4-proper-motion"></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>This is likely the final episode of day 1 in a two day
workshop.</p></li>
<li><p>This episode takes a slight detour to introduce a few features of
Pandas DataFrames. To keep this connected to the story, you can talk
about how data exploration is an important part of prototyping your
query and making sure you are getting the results you expect in the
format you expect them in.</p></li>
<li><p>Starting with selecting the centerline, we do a series of filters
on different data frames. Take a minute before you teach this section to
make sure you understand what each one represents. We use
<code>results_df</code> to build <code>centerline_df</code>. We use
<code>centerline_df</code> to determine proper motion limits. We use the
proper motion limits determined from <code>centerline_df</code> to
select GD-1 stars from <code>results_df</code>. This is
<code>selected_df</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Learners may ask why we did not select this close to the center
line from the beginning. It is also worth noting that we are selecting
stars close to the center line to identify the proper motion cut, so it
is ok if we exclude some GD-1 stars here. In this case we prefer a more
pure sample to a more complete sample. Once we have the proper motion
limits from our pure sample (<code>centerline_df</code>), we will
include the full spatial region (<code>results_df</code>) and get all of
the GD-1 stars (<code>selected_df</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>This episode uses the following idiom several times</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span><span class="va">x</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">...</span></span>
<span><span class="va">y</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">...</span></span>
<span><span class="fu">plt.plot</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">x</span>, <span class="va">y</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This idiom violates the recommendation not to repeat variables names,
but since they are defined and used immediately, it should be ok. This
syntax simplifies the final <code>plot</code> expression making it
easier to read.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Learners may be concerned that we are writing a function for
later that does not fill the full canvas (when we set
<code>axis('equal')</code> in the proper motion selected stars figure).
You can reassure them that in episode 7 we will take care of this by
learning how to set the figure size, the subplot size, and we will be
using a larger spatial area (that we define in episode 4).</p></li>
<li><p>Notice that the previous episode when we used
<code>DataFrame.to_hdf</code> included the <code>mode="w"</code>
argument to indicate that we want to create a new, empty HDF Store. For
this (and subsequent) episode(s), we should <em>not</em> use the
<code>mode="w"</code> argument, so that we add new Datasets to the
existing Store, rather than starting over.</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of Day 1, if a student is lost or struggled with the
end of this episode, point them to their local copy of the HDF5 files so
that they can read it in with everyone else on Day 2. They will have
downloaded this file as part of the set up in the
<code>student_download/data directory/</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>If a learner notices that there is a <code>/</code> in front of
the keys at the end of the episode here is what they mean:
<code>/</code> indicates that the keys are at the top level of the
Dataset hierarchy, and not in a named “group”. In future episodes we
will add a few more Datasets to this file, but not so many that we need
to organize them into groups.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="episode-5-coordinate-transformation-and-selection">Episode 5: Coordinate transformation and selection<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#episode-5-coordinate-transformation-and-selection"></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>This is likely the first episode of Day 2. You should start by
having learners start a new notebook. They will need to read in the data
they saved yesterday to HDF5 files and the functions they wrote
yesterday. You can follow the directions under the collapsable section
at the beginning of this episode called “Starting from this episode”. If
you are using files from the <code>student_download</code> directory be
sure to add the correct path
<code>student_download/backup-data/&lt;filename&gt;</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>This episode is faster than it looks because learners have seen
much of the content already</p></li>
<li><p>As in previous episodes, a challenge for learners here is keeping
track of what we are doing and why. Surface periodically to remind them
where we are. The big focus of this episode is that now that we have
determined how to filter based on proper motion and eliminated most of
the contaminating stars from our prototype, we can repeat the query,
this time on the full spatial extent of GD-1 rather than the small
portion we used for our prototype.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of ConvexHull in this episode is a bit of a hack, but
some learners will find the computation geometry functions in SciPy
useful.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure to review the query
<code>candidate_coord_query_base</code> from Episode 2 (this will happen
naturally when you have to retype it) and remind learners what each
filter does and why we are using it</p></li>
<li><p>Notice that the definitions of <code>phi1_min</code>,
<code>phi1_max</code>, etc. are different in this episode. Because we
are adding more filters, we can select a bigger region without exceeding
resource limits. If learners do not get as many “candidates” as
expected, they might be using the old values of these bounds.</p></li>
<li><p>Defining the new region is a good opportunity to go back to the
figure and connect these coordinates to the physical picture of GD-1
(e.g. before we were only selecting from this region now we are
expanding it to this whole region)</p></li>
<li><p>Learners may ask why we are using
<code>dict(key1=value1, key2=value2)</code> rather than
<code>{key1:value1, key2:value2}</code>. We are using the
<code>dict</code> syntax so that the key value pairs look like keyword
arguments. This may simplify the understanding for learners who are less
familiar with dictionaries.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, in this episode we should <em>not</em> use the
<code>mode="w"</code> argument, so that we add new Datasets to the
existing Store, rather than starting over.</p></li>
<li>
<p>when writing the <code>point_series</code> object to an HDF5
file, learners may see the warning message like the following:</p>

[inferred_type-&gt;mixed,key-&gt;values] [items-&gt;None]</p>
<p>pytables.to_hdf( ```</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This warning is saying that pickle will be slow for large objects. We
do not need to worry about this since the objects we are saving are
small.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If learners struggle with the query exercise - remind them that
we are defining a polygon in the same way we did before (with the same
syntax) but looking at proper motion instead of space.</p></li>
<li><p>Learners should get the same number of candidates. If they get a
different number it is likely they mistyped something.</p></li>

<h3 id="episode-6-joining-tables">Episode 6: Joining tables<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#episode-6-joining-tables"></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The early part of this episode brings back a lot of best
practices that learners learned in previous episodes (e.g. exploring
tables, returning the top 5 rows) this is a great opportunity to
highlight these and remind learners that they have seen this before and
why we are doing it.</p></li>
<li><p>Although we do not immediately use the column definitions in
<code>panstarrs1_best_neighbour</code>, we will come back to them in the
data exploration part of this episode.</p></li>
<li><p>Throughout this episode continue to come back to the central
theme of starting with a simple query and building up layers of
complexity, testing each layer as you go.</p></li>
<li><p>The Pan-STARRS join exercise is likely to feel scary to a lot of
learners - they have only seen one example. Emphasize the building
blocks of a <code>JOIN</code>
e.g. <code>FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.common_column=table2.common_column</code>.
It is also worth pointing out that common_column will not have the same
names in this case.</p></li>
<li><p>While CSV files are the most basic file format, if you are
running short on time, this section can be skipped or abbreviated as
learners have often likely encountered CSV files and writing them is not
essential to the rest of the curriculum.</p></li>
<li><p>In case a learner asks about the extra <code>unnamed</code>
column in the CSV section here is the explanation. You may notice that
all Pandas <code>DataFrame</code>s have an index column which was not
part of the original table definition. This essentially numbers each
row. When we write a <code>DataFrame</code> in any other format, the
index gets treated like a bonafide column. For this reason when we write
a CSV file and then read it back into a <code>DataFrame</code> the index
column gets written as an <code>unnamed</code> column and then when it
is read back in, another index column is created leading to two
extraneous columns.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="episode-7-photometry">Episode 7: Photometry<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#episode-7-photometry"></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>It is easy in this episode to lose track of the main point: that
we want to define a polygon around the main sequence of GD-1 so we can
further hone our sample of candidate GD-1 stars. As we spend time on the
isochrone, creating the polygon, etc make sure to come back to this big
picture often.</p></li>
<li><p>The key take away from the CMD presentation is that GD-1 is a
globular cluster which means all of the stars formed at the same time.
Therefore we expect the stars in GD-1 to follow a single, tight
isochrone, the main sequence of which we can easily identify.</p></li>
<li><p>We did have to manipulate the MIST isochrone to get it from what
is available for download to what we read in. This is too much detail
for the curriculum, but the process is detailed in <a href="calculating_MIST_isochrone.html">Making the Isochrone
Dataframe</a> if you or a learner is interested.</p></li>
<li><p>In the original paper, they use an idiosyncratic function to
define the boundaries of the isochrone filter. The intention is to
define a polygon that gets wider as g increases, to reflect increasing
uncertainty. For this exercise we will be using a simplified version
which is a constant offset from the isochrone.</p></li>
<li><p>Turning the selection we have defined into a polygon (making a
loop) can be challenging to explain verbally but fairly simple visually.
This is a nice time to return to the slides or draw a picture</p></li>
<li><p>In the manipulation we do to create the polygon, it can get lost
that <code>left_color</code>, <code>right_color</code>, and
<code>color_loop</code> are all x values for the polygon (and that
<code>g</code> and <code>mag_loop</code> are the y values). It is worth
coming back to this over and over as you introduce each
variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Learners might express concern that the polygon we use to select
candidate stars is not closed. That is ok; the
<code>contains_points</code> method treats the polygon as if it is
closed (by connecting the last point to the first).</p></li>
<li><p>Learners may notice that <code>contains_points</code> is not
actually a <code>Polygon</code> property. <code>Polygon</code> inherits
this method from <code>Patch</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>We mention usetex in the discussion of TeX markup in matplotlib.
This option does not work for all operating system/backend combinations
(in our first alpha pilot some notebooks required restarting after
trying to use this option). But, one error that can be fixed is
<code>LaTeX Error: File 'type1cm.sty' not found.</code> Learners with
this error might have to install a package that contains the fonts LaTeX
needs. On some systems, the packages <code>texlive-latex-extra</code> or
<code>cm-super</code> might be what they need. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11354149/python-unable-to-render-tex-in-matplotlib" class="external-link">See
here for more help with this</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Learners may ask why we are initializing an empty array and then
creating the columns on the fly. DataFrame initializes with arrays of
rows rather than columns, so this is the easiest way without having to
do some array manipulation. See <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html" class="external-link">https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html</a>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>This episode is largely about showing learners selected
capabilities that will make their lives easier. Matplotlib is a huge
package with infinite flexibility - this is in no way complete but
hopefully gives them some barebones tools to work with and inspired them
to explore further.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition to the links provided in the episode it is nice to
show learners the <a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/pyplot_summary.html" class="external-link">list of
plotting commands</a> and the <a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html" class="external-link">examples
gallery</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>This episode is also a great place to show them how useful the
functions we wrote in previous episodes are.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are running short on time, the discussion of customization
can be shortened or eliminated and exercises such as adding annotation
could be done together as a class.</p></li>
